## Description 
This project is an app that connects a user to a heroku server and database that will allow the user to store their notes online and access them! The main body of this code comes from the UW-EDX Bootcamp. This includes the front-end application and all relavent JS and HTML files. Most of the Javascript also comes from the bootcamp including the basic setup of a modular server. Ultimately, the only aspects of the code presented here that are uniquely mine are around the connection between the various endpoints to the front-end application. But I want to stress that around 90-95% of the js code proper came from the bootcamp.
